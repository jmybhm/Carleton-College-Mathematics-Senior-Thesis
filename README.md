# Senior-Thesis
This repository includes my senior thesis paper and R codes used for the project. I collaborated with three other Carleton Math major students to explore potential ways to draw a causal conclusion from non-experimental settings. Below is the abstract of the paper.

In perhaps every field, the most fundamental research questions often ask: “what is the relationship between
X and Y? In particular, does X cause Y?” Causal inference is devoted to uncovering and improving research
methods that enable investigators to measure the size and significance of causal effects of treatment on
outcomes. In this paper, we reflect upon and extend the development of causal inference techniques in a
variety of contexts: randomized experiments, observational studies, and retrospective studies. We use a
dataset capturing the effect of a job training program on unemployment in order to evaluate the performances
of causal inference techniques in each of these types of study design, and also propose a novel approach to
retrospective causal inference called the Retrospective Exposure Case (REC) Score. We find that matching
using the propensity score method in the prospective setting offers a marked improvement over non-matching
approaches, and comes very close to recovering the experimental estimate; we further see promise in the REC
Score matching analysis, which bests all other retrospective and prospective analyses we attempted.
